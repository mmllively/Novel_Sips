                Maggie Lively recently relocated to Orlando from the Washington D.C. area where
                she owned a yoga studio. Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, she spent the last couple
                of years teaching online learning more about dynamic websites and interactive
                technology to reach students. Creating and editing videos for her website sparked
                an interest in web development.<br>
                <br>
                Maggie decided to enroll in the UCF Coding Bootcamp to pursue a career in front-end
                web development. She enjoys creating new websites and applications that are attractive
                and user-friendly. She looks forward to learning more about web-development throughout
                the course and beyond.<br>
