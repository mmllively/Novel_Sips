                We met while enrolled in the Full-Stack Web Development Coding
                Bootcamp at UCF, and were tasked together to develop this website.<br>
                <br>
                This project took a lot of time and dedication, and we will keep working
                on it to improve it's functionality and appearance with the skills we will
                continue to learn and develop while enrolled in the Coding Bootcamp.

                Maggie Lively recently relocated to Orlando from the Washington D.C. area where
                she owned a yoga studio. Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, she spent the last couple
                of years teaching online learning more about dynamic websites and interactive
                technology to reach students. Creating and editing videos for her website sparked
                an interest in web development.<br>
                <br>
                Maggie decided to enroll in the UCF Coding Bootcamp to pursue a career in front-end
                web development. She enjoys creating new websites and applications that are attractive
                and user-friendly. She looks forward to learning more about web-development throughout
                the course and beyond.<br>
